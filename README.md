# thunk-alternative-middleware
Test React/Redux application using alternative async processing with custom middleware instead of popular generic middleware packages

## Purpose

The goal of this project is test creating a project without using popular middleware (ie: Thunk, Saga, Observables, etc...), but instead to use a custom middleware to handle all async actions for us.  This is based on an article written by Christian Chown on Medium (see article [here](https://medium.com/@christianchown/dont-use-async-redux-middleware-c8a1015299ec))

## Application

This demo application will be built using the following main tools

* create-react-ap
* TypeScript
* React
* Redux
* ChakraUI
* React Router
